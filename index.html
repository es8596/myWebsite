<h1>Trainers</h1>
<p>.In life, trainers, or in North America, sneakers, are a huge thing to people, with collecters spending most of their life savings on them and them and having huge displaysI think Nike outclasses pretty
  on their walls, and mega shops known for selling huge shoe models like Foot Locker, Nike, and Adidas. As for the biggest shoe brand in the world, I would say Nike as they have produced tons of incredibly popular shoesand. 
  And, as for the greatest shoe of all time, I would say that the legendary Jordan 1 wins that. The infamous colourways that it has produced in it's 38 years has deffinetly attracted the eyes of many people. 
  In my opinion, I would say that my faviroute colorway it have produced is the Chicago, with its notorious red white, and a hint of black. The Jordan line has kept on running, with Nike producing 12 versions. Not many
  of them have been popular, I would say, exept for the 4, it has been pretty popular; and I would say that it is probably the most popular Jordan in the Jordan line if you count out the Jordan 1
  colourway</p>
