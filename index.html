<h1>Formula 1</h1>
<p>.Formula 1 over the years has signifficantly increased from 12%, in 2017, to a massive 34% in 2021. F1 has had a history of ranging from drivers having their lowest peak going down in history,
  to drivers who gained massive success and have broken records for the sport. Lucky enough for us, the world of F1 still holds arguably one of the best ever racing drivers of all time - Lewis Hamilton.
  Who in which over a massive 16 years, has won 7 championships, leading up to 103 Grand Prix wins.
